  <b>BlackRock</b> was founded in 1988 by <bold>Larry Fink</bold>, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson[9] to provide institutional clients with asset management services from a risk management perspective.[10] Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States.[11] During Fink's tenure, he had lost $90 million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management.[12] In exchange for a 50 percent stake in the bond business, initially Blackstone gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line. Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion. The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff.[12]

By 1992, Blackstone had a stake equating to about 35% of the company, and Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink were considering selling shares to the public.[13] The firm adopted the name BlackRock, and was managing $17 billion in assets by the end of the year. At the end of 1994, BlackRock was managing $53 billion.[14] In 1994, Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over methods of compensation and equity.[13] Fink wanted to share equity with new hires, to lure talent from banks, unlike Schwarzman, who did not want to further lower Blackstone's stake.[13] They agreed to part ways, and Schwarzman sold BlackRock, a decision he later called a "heroic mistake."[13][15] In June 1994, Blackstone sold a mortgage-securities unit with $23 billion in assets to PNC Bank Corp. for $240 million.[16] The unit had traded mortgages and other fixed-income assets, and during the sales process the unit changed its name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock Financial Management.[13] Schwarzman remained with Blackstone, while Fink went on to become chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc.[13]
1999â€“2009

BlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share[17] on the New York Stock Exchange.[14] By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets.[14] BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition. In August 2004, BlackRock made its first major acquisition, buying State Street Research & Management's holding company SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for $325 million in cash and $50 million in stock. The acquisition raised BlackRock's assets under management from $314 billion to $325 billion.[18] The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research & Management in 2005.[16] BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM) in 2006,[14][19] halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company.[20] In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management.[21][22]

The U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help resolve the fallout of the financial meltdown of 2008. According to Vanity Fair, the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street believed BlackRock was the best choice for the job.[23] The Federal Reserve allowed BlackRock to superintend the $130 billion-debt settlement of Bear Stearns and American International Group.[24]

In 2009, BlackRock first became the No. 1 asset manager worldwide.[16] In April 2009, BlackRock acquired R3 Capital Management, LLC and took control of the $1.5 billion fund.[25] On 12 June 2009, Barclays sold its Global Investors unit (BGI), which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion. Through the deal, Barclays attained a near-20% stake in BlackRock.[26]
